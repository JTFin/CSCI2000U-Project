## Introduction
The topic you will be reading is about the aformentioned IMDB's most popular list of films and series(shows). This dataset was chosen as the topic we would cover as it contains a rich amount of entries, and many different category types to consider, which will make it much easier to perform the exploratory data analysis(EDA) phase of this project. Most importantly; due to the interesting and entertaining nature of movies and series, everyone was more than comfortable with working with this specific dataset, and digging deep into why points in the data, are the way they are.

If you are a film or tv lover, and always wondered why movies haven't been great in recent years, or why your favourite show got worse as it went on; this may be the report for you!

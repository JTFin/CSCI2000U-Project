    "We chose this dataset pulled off of Kaggle because it pertains to movies and tv series, which everyone in the group is familiar with, and also has an interest in. Going through other datasets, we were often disappointed either by the lack of data, or the range of categories that are covered within the dataset. This dataset was able to do what we needed: have lots of data we can parse, and have lots of columns we can work with.\n",

    "   - How does the amount of episodes in a tv show effect the ratings? For shows with a greater amount of episodes,\n",

    "   - What are considered popular genres over the years? Do the ratings correlate? \n",
    "   - What impact does mature content make on the ratings of movies/shows the most?\n",

    "The IMDB's most popular film and series dataset is a list described by its name. In this dataset we can see a range of movies and films from the early 20th century to the current year, with information about the movie such as duration, genre, number of episodes, as well as user engagement information such as ratings and votes. All these datapoints can prove to be useful when diving into the analysis of said data.\n",
